## Abstract
Dynamics within and between functional resting‐state networks have a crucial role in determining both healthy and pathological brain functioning in humans. The possibility to noninvasively interact and selectively modulate the activity of networks would open to relevant applications in neuroscience. Here we tested a novel approach for multichannel, network‐targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net‐tDCS), optimized to increase excitability of the sensorimotor network (SMN) while inducing cathodal inhibitory modulation over prefrontal and parietal brain regions negatively correlated with the SMN. Using an MRI‐compatible multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) device, 20 healthy participants underwent real and sham tDCS while at rest in the MRI scanner. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) during and after stimulation were evaluated, looking at the intrinsic FC of the SMN and the strength of the negative connectivity between SMN and the rest of the brain. Standard, bifocal tDCS targeting left motor cortex (electrode ~C3) and right frontopolar (~Fp2) regions was tested as a control condition in a separate sample of healthy subjects to investigate network specificity of multichannel stimulation effects. Net‐tDCS induced greater FC increase over the SMN compared to bifocal tDCS, during and after stimulation. Moreover, exploratory analysis of the impact of net‐tDCS on negatively correlated networks showed an increase in the negative connectivity between SMN and prefrontal/parietal areas targeted by cathodal stimulation both during and after real net‐tDCS. Results suggest preliminary evidence of the possibility of manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns through net‐tDCS, with potential relevance for the development of cognitive enhancement and therapeutic tES solutions.
