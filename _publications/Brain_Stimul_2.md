## Abstract
Over the past decade, the number of experimental and clinical studies using theta-burst-stimulation (TBS) protocols of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate brain activity has risen substantially. The use of TBS is motivated by the assumption that these protocols can reliably and lastingly modulate cortical excitability despite their short duration and low number of stimuli. However, this assumption, and thus the experimental validity of studies using TBS, is challenged by recent work showing large inter- and intra-subject variability in response to TBS protocols. To date, the reproducibility of TBS effects in humans has been exclusively assessed with motor evoked potentials (MEPs), which provide an indirect and limited measure of cortical excitability. Here we combined TMS with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) and report the first comprehensive investigation of (1) direct TMS-evoked cortical responses to intermittent (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) of the human motor cortex, and (2) reproducibility of both iTBS- and cTBS-induced cortical response modulation against a robust sham control across repeat visits with commonly used cortical responsivity metrics. We show that although single pulse TMS generates stable and reproducible cortical responses across visits, the modulatory effects of TBS vary substantially both between and within individuals. Overall, at the group level, most measures of the iTBS and cTBS-induced effects were not significantly different from sham-TBS. Most importantly, none of the significant TBS-induced effects observed in visit-1 were reproduced in visit-2. Our findings suggest that the generally accepted mechanisms of TBS-induced neuromodulation, i.e. through changes in cortical excitability, may not be accurate. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the established therapeutic effects of TBS in neuropsychiatry and examine reproducibility of TBS-induced neuromodulation through oscillatory response dynamics.
