## Abstract
Recent studies have synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) application with pre-defined brain oscillatory phases showing how the effect of a perturbation depends on the brain state. However, none so far have investigated whether if phase-dependent TMS can possibly modulate connectivity with homologous distant brain regions belonging to the same network. In the framework of network-targeted TMS, we investigated whether stimulation delivered at a specific phase of ongoing brain oscillations might favor stronger cortico-cortical synchronization of distant network nodes connected to the stimulation target. Neuronavigated TMS pulses were delivered over the primary motor cortex during ongoing electroencephalography recording in twenty-four healthy individuals over two repeated sessions 1-month apart. Stimulation effects were analyzed considering whether the TMS pulse was delivered at the time of a positive (peak) or negative (trough) phase of μ-frequency oscillation, which determines cortico-cortical synchrony within homologous areas of the sensorimotor network. Diffusion Weighted Imaging was used to study cortico-cortical connectivity within the sensorimotor network and identify contralateral regions connected with the stimulation spot. Depending on when during the µ-activity the TMS-pulse was applied (peak or trough), the impact on inter-hemispheric network synchrony varied significantly. Higher cortico-cortical phase-lock synchronization with interconnected contralateral homologous regions after the TMS-pulse (0-200ms) in the μ-frequency band was found for trough compared to peak stimulation trials in both study visits. Phase-dependent TMS delivery might be crucial not only to amplify local effects but also to increase magnitude and reliability of within-network synchronization, with implications for interventions aimed at engaging more distributed functional brain networks.
