## Abstract
Information processing in the brain is mediated by structural white matter pathways and is highly dependent on topological brain properties. Here we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), specifically looking at macroscale connectivity to understand whether regional, network-level or whole-brain structural properties are more responsible for stimulus propagation. Neuronavigated TMS pulses were delivered over two individually defined nodes of the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks in a group of healthy subjects, with test-retest reliability assessed 1-month apart. TMS-evoked activity was predicted by the modularity and structural integrity of the stimulated network rather than the targeted region(s) or the whole-brain connectivity, suggesting network-level structural connectivity as more relevant than local brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation. The importance of network structural connectome was unveiled only by evoked activity, but not resting-state data. Future clinicals interventions might enhance target engagement by adopting DWI-guided, network-focused TMS.
