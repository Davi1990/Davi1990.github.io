# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Neuroscience, Imaging and Clinical Sciences](https://www.dni.unich.it/dottorato/business-and-behavioural-sciences) at [University "G. d'Annunzio" of Chieti](http://www.bbs.unich.it/). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://davi1990.github.io/files/CV_Davide_Momi-merged.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I-BACCgAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests focus on integrating multimodal neuroimaging techniques with electrophysiological measures in order to optimize noninvasive brain stimulation intervention. I have experience in the following: neuroimaging (e.g. DTI, fMRI, ASL) analysis, TMS applications, machine learning model building, EEG data collection and analysis, quantitative structural MRI assessment (e.g. brain morphometry, cortical thickness etc.), cognitive tasks development.
* I received my Master’s Degree in "Neuroscience and Neuropsychological Rehabilitation" from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/degree-programmes/programme/2014/0989).
