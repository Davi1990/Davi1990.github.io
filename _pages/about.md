# About Me
* I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Whole Brain Modelling Group](https://www.grifflab.com/) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics - CAMH](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://davi1990.github.io/files/CV_Davide_Momi-merged.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I-BACCgAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Neuroscience, Imaging and Clinical Sciences](https://en.unich.it/ugov/organizationunit/17147) at [University "G. d'Annunzio" of Chieti](http://www.bbs.unich.it/) which was focused on integrating multimodal neuroimaging techniques with electrophysiological measures in order to optimize noninvasive brain stimulation intervention.
* Now my research is mainly focused on developing computational models of brain stimulation. I have experience in the following: neuroimaging (e.g. DTI, fMRI, ASL) analysis, TMS applications, machine learning model building, EEG data collection and analysis, quantitative structural MRI assessment (e.g. brain morphometry, cortical thickness etc.), cognitive tasks development.
* I received my Master’s Degree in "Neuroscience and Neuropsychological Rehabilitation" from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/degree-programmes/programme/2014/0989).
